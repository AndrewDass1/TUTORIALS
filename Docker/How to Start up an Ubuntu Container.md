## What is Docker?
Docker is a software that creates containers. Containers are built to run fully developed applications which could be shared and run on other computers.
For example, if one computer contains the source code for a Word Generator application, it could be distributed through other computers by first converting the source
code into an image and run it to make a container to access the application. It is optional the image can be published to Dockerhub, where other computers 
can download the image and run it. Dockerhub is a place where pre-existing Docker images exist, and this tutorial will demonstrate how to download the official 
Ubuntu image and run it. To visit Dockerhub and see many pre-existing images, please visit the official website: https://hub.docker.com/
